You get to see how every element matters, from the exact length of platforms, to the precise angle of Mario’s jump. It’s like going to a painting lesson with Picasso.\nGame Builder Garage broadens the canvas offered by its predecessors by allowing users to construct pretty much any kind of game, from racers to 3D action adventures – all via a cute, powerful visual programming language. Here, the coding experience is represented on a graph paper screen, with each component, whether that’s objects, actions or outcomes, represented as anthropomorphised blocks named Nodons, that you can pick up, move around and link together to create programs. Want to be able to move a character on screen? Simply select a Person Nodon, then an “Input” Nodon and link them together. Each object has a series of properties, that can be switched on or off, making them, say, destructible, transparent and/or movable depending on their role in your masterpiece.\n Continue reading...",

If this were a piece of golden age detective fiction, the fate of the drowned man would form the basis of an intriguing whodunnit, but in the hands of narrative game specialist Inkle – a team that skilfully turned Jules Verne’s Around the World in 80 Days into a luscious interactive adventure – it was never going to be so straightforward.\nInstead, Overboard! is told from the killer’s perspective, the player taking on the role of faded screen idol Veronica Villensey who launches her spouse Malcolm into the Atlantic in order to claim his life insurance. From this point on, your job is to create an alibi for Veronica as well as perhaps implicating another passenger in Malcolm’s watery demise. This is achieved by touring the ship and chatting to other characters – some of whom can be useful allies, while others may have secrets to hide that can be exploited to divert attention or even set up ulterior suspects. The game has an internal clock that ticks towards your arrival in New York, so any plan you formulate has to be tidily and swiftly enacted, relying on certain characters being in the right place at the right time, and important objects such as keys, sleeping pills and damning documents being discovered and utilised.\n Continue reading...",

Still smarting from when Amazon fired him last year, the 32-year-old is spearheading an effort to unionize more than 5,000 workers at four Amazon facilities in Staten Island, including a giant warehouse.\nSmalls is taking a highly unusual route in pursuing this goal; he has founded an independent union, the Amazon Labor Union, convinced that a new union comprising only Amazon workers is the smartest way to rally Amazon employees behind a union after the crushing defeat of an effort to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama earlier this year.\n Continue reading...",

          "description": "Available online\nThe age of peak podcast meets its match in John-Luke Roberts and his procession of hilariously titled imaginary shows\nIn 2018, John-Luke Roberts’s Edinburgh show consisted entirely of names of hitherto unheard-of Spice Girls. He’s up to something similar with Sound Heap, a new “podcast of infinite podcasts”, a medley of excerpts from imaginary podcasts performed by a galaxy of comedy stars. As a vehicle to parody the current glut of (celebrity, hobbyist and vanishingly niche) audio series, it works a treat, as Roberts lines up clips from Ventriloquists Talk True Crime, Memes with Val and Britain’s Worst Bastards for our listening pleasure.\nNo one who has followed Roberts’s career will expect anything less than creative fecundity, and he certainly delivers: the ideas for ridiculous but just-about-credible podcasts keep coming. Occasionally, the titles are as funny as his sketches get. More often, those sketches seize the opportunities offered by Roberts’s instinct for absurdity, as when Pranks With Full Consent recasts Jeremy Beadle for the age of the trigger warning, or Passwords of My Life with Tom Allen imagines a celebrity so delighted to talk about himself, he barely notices the associated sacrifice in cyber-security.\n Continue reading...",

How you acquired them is probably best left between you and a priest, but you may have ripped them from a CD, downloaded them from a file sharing service, or bought them from one of a few nascent download sites.\nWhichever option you picked, you’d play them on your computer with a program built for the task.

She is an English literature student turned troll in St Petersburg. Once a lover of Emily Brontë books, she is now a kind of data apparatchik, paid to gather information on Brits online and then use it to “fuck with their heads” during the EU referendum campaign of 2016.\n Continue reading...",
