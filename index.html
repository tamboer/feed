                    <span>My friend Maureen Donnelly, who has died aged 71 of cancer, was a successful and creative businesswoman with socialist ideals and a belief in public service. She was also a rambler, adventurer and lover of Irish literature, and managed to be active in all these fields while also being a devoted single parent.
Born in Dungannon, County Tyrone, Maureen was the daughter of Mary (nee Barker) and Frank Donnelly, and one of five siblings brought up on a modest farm nearby. After leaving St Joseph’s convent school, Donaghmore, and studying maths at Queen’s University Belfast, she moved to London. Asked why, she replied that as a Catholic she couldn’t get work she wanted in Northern Ireland, and as a woman, she wouldn’t get such employment in Dublin.

Losses at the British fintech firm Revolut nearly doubled last year, despite cashing in on the year-end cryptocurrency boom.
The company – founded by the former Lehman Brothers trader Nik Storonsky and chaired by the ex-Standard Life Aberdeen boss Martin Gilbert – said it made £39m on its cryptocurrency investments last year, while growing demand for its crypto trading services helped pushed revenues up 34% to £222m in the 12 months to 31 December.

                    <span>Nature is full of examples of biology adapting to its surroundings. Technology may just be about to catch up
From the bottom of the oceans to the skies above us, natural evolution has filled our planet with a vast and diverse array of lifeforms, with approximately 8 million species adapted to their surroundings in a myriad of ways. Yet 100 years after Karel Čapek coined the term robot, the functional abilities of many species still surpass the capabilities of current human engineering, which has yet to convincingly develop methods of producing robots that demonstrate human-level intelligence, move and operate seamlessly in challenging environments, and are capable of robust self-reproduction.
But could robots ever reproduce? This, undoubtedly, forms a pillar of “life” as shared by all natural organisms. A team of researchers from the UK and the Netherlands have recently demonstrated a fully automated technology to allow physical robots to repeatedly breed, evolving their artificial genetic code over time to better adapt to their environment. Arguably, this amounts to artificial evolution. Child robots are created by mixing the digital “DNA” from two parent robots on a computer.

Socializing, parties and late night trips are all coming back as the coronavirus pandemic recedes in the US and along with them has come a surge in the price of calling a cab. It’s good news for Uber and Lyft, but for the rideshare drivers who were hit so hard by the pandemic? Not so much.
“We’re making less than normal,” said Robert Eaton of Reno, Nevada, a full-time Uber driver for over two years. He tries to work as many hours as possible every week to provide for his family, citing his most common shift is 16 hours, noon to 4am. “While fares have skyrocketed in this market, the drivers’ pay has not been raised at all.”

Even if your garden was designed to look like a meadow of wildflowers, chances are you have some non-living component, like rocks or a fence. That’s the “hardscape,” and the plants are the “softscape.”…

The number of UK adults who hold cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin has risen to an estimated 2.3 million, despite warnings from regulators and the head of the Bank of England that people should be prepared to lose all their money.
Research by the Financial Conduct Authority also revealed that almost 20% of buyers said they were driven by a fear of missing out, while one in seven were going into the red to finance their cryptocurrency purchases.

Ransomware has roared into the headlines in recent weeks after criminal hacking networks, tentatively linked to Russia, launched attacks on the major US meat packing plant JBS and the nation’s largest fuel pipeline. 
Joe Biden and his administration are scrambling to address the growing threat, pressing Vladimir Putin in a highly anticipated meeting on Wednesday to take action against the rise of ransomware attacks. Biden said he gave Putin a list of 16 areas – mostly in critical infrastructure - that are “off limits” for cyber-attacks.

We all wanted to see Metroid Prime 4, the long-anticipated first-person science-fiction shooter-adventure that has been in development at Nintendo for an absolute age. But instead we got a whole new Metroid – a 2D one in the vein of the SNES and Game Boy Advance classics, the first game in the series in this style for about 19 years. Metroid Dread features Samus Aran being chased by distressing, transforming drone-robots who appear to be largely impervious to her ever-expanding array of weapons, and it looks genuinely scary. It’ll be out on 8 October on Nintendo Switch.

From Mario Kart racers to 2D platforms, this charming game-maker gives you access to the Nintendo toolkit

One of the most wonderful elements of Nintendo’s Super Mario Maker titles, which give players the chance to build their own platformers, is that they provide a glimpse at how Nintendo thinks about game design. You get to see how every element matters, from the exact length of platforms, to the precise angle of Mario’s jump. It’s like going to a painting lesson with Picasso.
Game Builder Garage broadens the canvas offered by its predecessors by allowing users to construct pretty much any kind of game, from racers to 3D action adventures – all via a cute, powerful visual programming language. Here, the coding experience is represented on a graph paper screen, with each component, whether that’s objects, actions or outcomes, represented as anthropomorphised blocks named Nodons, that you can pick up, move around and link together to create programs. Want to be able to move a character on screen? Simply select a Person Nodon, then an “Input” Nodon and link them together. Each object has a series of properties, that can be switched on or off, making them, say, destructible, transparent and/or movable depending on their role in your masterpiece.

In December of last year, a handful of diners sat down to a futuristic meal at 1880, a members-only restaurant in Singapore. The star ingredient was “no-kill” chicken – raised not on a farm but in a laboratory bioreactor. Attendees snacked on lab-grown nuggets paired with crispy maple waffles, bao buns, and black bean puree.
For the California entrepreneur Josh Tetrick, it was a breakthrough. His company, Eat Just, had become the first in the world to sell the product after receiving approval from Singapore authorities. Headlines hailed a landmark step in the quest to end animal agriculture, upend the meat industry and redefine our diets.

                    <span>There was no Switch Pro announcement, but Nintendo brought Zelda, Metroid and WarioWare to its E3 show
Nintendo showed new footage of the long-awaited sequel Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild 2 during its E3 live stream on Tuesday afternoon, along with a tentative launch date of 2022.
The company revealed a new teaser for the game, which is set in the same world as its critically acclaimed predecessor. This time, the action will take in the skies above Hyrule as well as on land, with Link able to fly to islands floating far above the Earth.

                    <span>Guardian Australia picture editor Carly Earl explains the dos and don’ts of photographing the moon
When a full moon rises, many people will pull out their mobile phones to try and get an Instagram-worthy photograph, but unfortunately the moon is really challenging to get a great photo of.
Two reasons: it is very far away and unless you have a telephoto lens (which makes the moon appear closer than it is) it will always appear as a very small glowing dot in the frame.

It’s been 40 years since Lisa Donnan has queued for gas. But last month the cybersecurity expert found herself joining the long lines of cars across the east coast of the US looking for fuel after the latest in a series of cyber-attacks had shut down the pipeline that provides fuel to 45% of the region.
“The last time I did that was in the Iran crisis,” she said. “My dad had to wait with me.”

Ransomware represents the biggest threat to online security for most people and businesses in the UK, the head of GCHQ’s cybersecurity arm is to warn.
Lindy Cameron, chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, will say in a speech that the phenomenon, where hackers encrypt data and demand payment for it to be restored, is escalating and becoming increasingly professionalised.

 7.43pm BST 
Virtual E3 is all a bit weird and disappointing but there were some great-looking games in Microsoft and Bethesda’s line-up. Here’s all the news, for those just joining us:
 7.23pm BST 
It’s something new from Arkane, makers of Dishonored and Prey. It’s an Xbox exclusive, an open-world shooter that you can apparently play alone or with friends. We’re seeing Heroes-esque young things with telekinetic powers, perusing a destroyed storefront. Then we see what happened: a supernatural firefight against VAMPIRES, assisted by locals who apparently worship them. They have a glowing purple Tardis and a robot dog? I’m into this. It’s called Redfall and it’s out summer next year.

                    <span>Tom Davies has 925,000 subscribers who watch his attempts to cross countries without making a turn

When Tom Davies and his stepbrother, Greg, were growing up on the edge of Aldridge, a town in the West Midlands, they would pick a point in the distance, a TV mast for instance, and make their way straight there, even if it meant clambering through quarries, sneaking across railway tracks and running away from angry farmers.
Now Davies has channelled this childhood taste for adventure into a YouTube series following his attempts to traverse entire countries in a direct line, based on GPS tracking.
The scrapes he finds himself in along the way, from almost drowning in swollen rivers and slashing his hand on barbed wire in Wales to a run-in with the police in Scotland, combined with his laid-back humour (he describes Norway as “Wales on steroids”), have garnered him a huge fanbase, with 925,000 subscribers to his channel.
Videos documenting his most recent “straight line mission” across Scotland are currently racking up hundreds of thousands of views, with the next episode set to go live on Sunday – and each one could be his last as obstacles threaten to cut short his journey..

A digital marketing firm closely linked to the pro-Trump youth group Turning Point USA was responsible for a series of deceptive Facebook ads promoting Green party candidates during the 2018 US midterm elections, the Guardian can reveal.
In an apparent attempt to split the Democratic vote in a number of close races, the ads purported to come from an organization called America Progress Now (APN) and used socialist memes and rhetoric to urge leftwing voters to support Green party candidates.

From John Carreyrou’s award-winning Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup to Reeves Wiedeman’s WeWork shakedown Billion Dollar Loser, the real-life stories coming out of startup land are so far-fetched that you could be forgiven for thinking there’s no ground left for invention.
So what role can fiction play in this world with no boundaries – between home and work, love and business, purpose and profit? Tahmima Anam’s fourth novel attempts to answer this by taking inspiration from her experience as executive director of ROLI, a music technology startup founded by her husband.

As someone who has just suffered through the living joyless hell of the Lego Incredibles game at a six-year-old’s insistence, I am the last person who needs to be reminded that video games based on movies are the second lowest form of art, after movies based on video games.
Did you ever play the White Men Can’t Jump game on the Atari Jaguar? Did you ever play the Hudson Hawk game on the Amiga? Did you ever, for the love of all that is holy, shell out money to play the Street Fighter: The Movie game (based, in a nightmarish helix spiral of market synergy, on a film that was based on a game) on the original PlayStation? If you did – or if you’ve played games based on Scarface, Planet of the Apes, Platoon, Porky’s, The Italian Job or either of the first two Godfather films – you’ll know to instantly equate a movie licence with a terrible game.

Tuesday morning’s 45-minute internet outage, which knocked out the Gov.uk domain as well as a string of publishers and other websites, cannot easily be dismissed as an isolated event. It demonstrates a lack of resilience at the heart of critical government services.
Anybody wanting to book a Covid test in the late morning on Gov.uk would have struggled. There is an alternative method, by phone, but who knows the number to call: 119? Government services that once delivered by form and post, then call centres, now only really exist through online connections.

The FBI set up its own encrypted platform used by hundreds of criminals around the world, in an “unprecedented” sting operation that led to more than 800 arrests in 18 countries, law enforcement officers have said.
The operation by the FBI and Australian and European police, ensnared suspects in Australia, Asia, Europe, South America and the Middle East involved in the narcotics trade.

It was mid-2018 when a convicted narcotics importer met with FBI agents from San Diego and made them a tantalising offer: in exchange for a possible reduction in the importer’s sentence on other charges, would the bureau like a backdoor into the encrypted communications of a vast network of international organised crime groups?
The importer had invested a “substantial amount” of money in developing an encrypted device which could be used by criminals around the world to avoid the detection of police.

The US justice department has recovered the majority of a multimillion-dollar ransom payment to hackers after a cyber-attack that caused the operator of the nation’s largest fuel pipeline to halt its operations last month, officials said on Monday.
The operation to recover the cryptocurrency from the Russia-based hacker group is the first undertaken by a specialized ransomware taskforce created by the Biden administration, and reflects what US officials say is an increasingly aggressive approach to deal with a ransomware threat that in the last month has targeted critical industries around the world.

Brad Stone, a senior editor at Bloomberg News, is now the author of a second book-length portrait of what may be the most successful business of the 21st century. When Stone’s first book, The Everything Store, was published in 2013, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was worth a piddling $27bn. That number has risen to $190bn, 70% more than he had at the beginning of the pandemic.

At least 10 US states have siphoned millions of dollars from federal block grants, meant to provide aid to their neediest families, to pay for the operations of ideological anti-abortion clinics.
These overwhelmingly Republican-led states used money from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (Tanf), better known as welfare or direct cash aid, to fund the activities of anti-abortion clinics associated with the evangelical right. The clinics work to dissuade women from obtaining abortions.

Christian Smalls has taken on the biggest challenge of his life. Still smarting from when Amazon fired him last year, the 32-year-old is spearheading an effort to unionize more than 5,000 workers at four Amazon facilities in Staten Island, including a giant warehouse.
Smalls is taking a highly unusual route in pursuing this goal; he has founded an independent union, the Amazon Labor Union, convinced that a new union comprising only Amazon workers is the smartest way to rally Amazon employees behind a union after the crushing defeat of an effort to unionize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama earlier this year.

The age of peak podcast meets its match in John-Luke Roberts and his procession of hilariously titled imaginary shows
In 2018, John-Luke Roberts’s Edinburgh show consisted entirely of names of hitherto unheard-of Spice Girls. He’s up to something similar with Sound Heap, a new “podcast of infinite podcasts”, a medley of excerpts from imaginary podcasts performed by a galaxy of comedy stars. As a vehicle to parody the current glut of (celebrity, hobbyist and vanishingly niche) audio series, it works a treat, as Roberts lines up clips from Ventriloquists Talk True Crime, Memes with Val and Britain’s Worst Bastards for our listening pleasure.
No one who has followed Roberts’s career will expect anything less than creative fecundity, and he certainly delivers: the ideas for ridiculous but just-about-credible podcasts keep coming. Occasionally, the titles are as funny as his sketches get. More often, those sketches seize the opportunities offered by Roberts’s instinct for absurdity, as when Pranks With Full Consent recasts Jeremy Beadle for the age of the trigger warning, or Passwords of My Life with Tom Allen imagines a celebrity so delighted to talk about himself, he barely notices the associated sacrifice in cyber-security.

In 2001, if you listened to digital music, you did it with a large folder of MP3 files. How you acquired them is probably best left between you and a priest, but you may have ripped them from a CD, downloaded them from a file sharing service, or bought them from one of a few nascent download sites.
Whichever option you picked, you’d play them on your computer with a program built for the task. And if you were lucky enough to have an early standalone MP3 player, it was probably made by another company again.

The second-generation Apple TV 4K gets a faster processor and future-proofed specs, but is really all about its new iPod-inspired Siri remote. And it all comes at a price.
Costing £169, the Apple media-streaming box is very much at the top of the market despite being £10 cheaper than its predecessor, with direct competitors priced between £50 and £130. But the Apple TV 4K offers something most others cannot: full integration with all of the iPhone-maker’s services including Siri, iTunes, TV+, Music, Fitness+ and the AirPlay 2 streaming system.
